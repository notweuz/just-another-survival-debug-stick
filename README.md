# ü™Ñ Just Another Survival Debug Stick

**A lightweight server-side Fabric mod that enables survival players to craft and use the Debug Stick with high customization.**

---

## üìñ Overview

The **Just Another Survival Debug Stick** mod allows players in survival mode to craft and use the Debug Stick just like in Creative
mode.  
It brings back the full power of block state editing ‚Äî now accessible without cheats or operator permissions.

This project is heavily inspired by [Just_S‚Äôs Survival Debug Stick (SDS)](https://modrinth.com/mod/survival-debug-stick)
mod but rewritten from scratch to be **simpler** (and probably more lightweight), and **up-to-date** (because Just_S's mod hasn't been updated for a while) with modern Minecraft versions.

## üîç  Showcase

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Mod allows you to configure whitelist and blacklist for both blocks and properties, as well as debug stick usage and swapping cooldown.

Config contains: `config.json`, `whitelist.json` and `blacklist.json` located in `jasds` folder inside default config folder

Example `config.json`:
```json5
{
  "propertySwapCooldown": 20, // cooldown for swapping between different properties
  "useCooldown": 15, // cooldown for using debug stick on a block
  "whitelistEnabled": false, // enables blocks & properties whitelist
  "blacklistEnabled": false // enables blocks & properties blacklist
}
```
Example `whitelist.json` and `blacklist.json`:
```json5
{
  /*
    All blocks formats should look like registry:blockid. For example default minecraft dirt block will be "minecraft:dirt"
    Example non-empty blocks section
    "blocks": ["minecraft:oak_leaves", "minecraft:furnace"]
    
    Properties names you can get by clicking with debug stick on block. For example default minecraft furnace lit property will be "lit"
    Example non-empty block section
    "properties": ["lit", "waterlogged"]
  */
  "blocks": [],
  "properties": []
}
```
