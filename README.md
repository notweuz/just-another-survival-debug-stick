# ü™Ñ Just Another Survival Debug Stick

**A lightweight server-side Fabric mod that enables survival players to craft and use the Debug Stick with high customization.**

---

## üìñ Overview

The **Just Another Survival Debug Stick** mod allows players in survival mode to craft and use the Debug Stick just like in Creative mode.  
It brings back the full power of block state editing ‚Äî now accessible without cheats or operator permissions.

This project is heavily inspired by [Just_S's Survival Debug Stick (SDS)](https://modrinth.com/mod/survival-debug-stick) mod but rewritten from scratch to be **simple** and **up-to-date** with modern versions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The mod allows you to configure whitelist and blacklist for both blocks and properties, as well as debug stick usage and swapping cooldown.

Config contains: `config.json`, `whitelist.json` and `blacklist.json` located in the `jasds` folder inside the default config folder.

Example `config.json`:
```json5
{
  "propertySwapCooldown": 20, // cooldown for swapping between different properties
  "useCooldown": 15, // cooldown for using debug stick on a block
  "whitelistEnabled": false, // enables blocks & properties whitelist
  "blacklistEnabled": false // enables blocks & properties blacklist
}
```

Example `whitelist.json` and `blacklist.json`:
```json5
{
  /*
    All block formats should look like registry:blockid. For example, the default Minecraft dirt block will be "minecraft:dirt"
    Example non-empty blocks section:
    "blocks": ["minecraft:oak_leaves", "minecraft:furnace"]
    
    Property names you can get by clicking with the debug stick on a block. For example, the default Minecraft furnace lit property will be "lit"
    Example non-empty properties section:
    "properties": ["lit", "waterlogged"]
  */
  "blocks": [],
  "properties": []
}
```
