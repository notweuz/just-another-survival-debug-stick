# ðŸª„ Survival Debug Stick

**A lightweight Fabric mod that enables survival players to craft and use the Debug Stick â€” without any restrictions,
literally.**

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

The **Survival Debug Stick** mod allows players in survival mode to craft and use the Debug Stick just like in Creative
mode.  
It brings back the full power of block state editing â€” now accessible without cheats or operator permissions.

This project is heavily inspired by [Just_Sâ€™s Survival Debug Stick (SDS)](https://modrinth.com/mod/survival-debug-stick)
mod but rewritten from scratch to be **lightweight**, and **up-to-date** with modern Minecraft versions.
